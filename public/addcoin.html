            <h2>Add a New Cryptocurrency</h2>
            <p>Listing a new cryptocurrency on Novixx Exchange incurs a one-time fee of $250 to cover administrative and technical costs.</p>
            <p>It will also require a liquidity pool of at least $50 in both the new coin and DGB to ensure smooth trading operations.</p>
